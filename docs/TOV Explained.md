Hydrostatic equilibrium:
dP/dr = -ρ(r)g(r)

"Pressure gradient balances gravitational force"
```

**Relativistic version (TOV equation):**
```
dP/dr = -(G/r²)[ρ(r) + P(r)/c²][M(r) + 4πr³P(r)/c²] / [1 - 2GM(r)/(rc²)]

Where:
- P(r) = pressure at radius r
- ρ(r) = density at radius r  
- M(r) = mass enclosed within radius r
- G, c = gravitational constant, speed of light

## Why We Need the Relativistic Version

For dense objects like neutron stars:
- Pressure contributes to gravity (P/c² term acts like mass)
- Spacetime curvature matters (denominator term)
- Cannot use simple Newtonian gravity

**When it matters:**
- Neutron stars: Yes (density ~10¹⁷ kg/m³)
- White dwarfs: Maybe (density ~10⁹ kg/m³)
- Normal stars: No (Newtonian is fine)
- Black holes: Definitely yes

## What It Tells Us

**Given:**
- Equation of state: P(ρ) - how pressure relates to density
- Central density: ρ_center

**TOV equation gives:**
- Pressure profile: P(r)
- Density profile: ρ(r)
- Total mass: M
- Total radius: R

**Famous result:** Maximum neutron star mass ≈ 2-2.5 M☉ (TOV limit)

## Do We Actually Need This?

**Good question!** For our purposes:

**Option A: Use full TOV**
- Pros: Rigorous, accurate
- Cons: Requires numerical integration, complicated

**Option B: Use simplified model**
- Pros: Analytical, intuitive
- Cons: Approximate

We are going with A
