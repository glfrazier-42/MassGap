# 1. Introduction
- There exists a mass gap from 2.5 to 5.0 $\text{M}\odot$, were there are very few observed celestial objects.
- There have been various mechanisms and rationale offered to explain this phenomenon.
- This paper analyzes the role of pressure and matter deconstruction in creating the mass gap. We show that, at a rest mass of X, which is observed as a gravitational mass of 2.52 $\text{M}\odot$, the pressure gradient at the edge of the quark core of a neutron star turns positive, resulting in an abrupt collapse to a 5.0 $\text{M}\odot$ black hole.
- We focus on neutron stars and incremental grows, using TOV to show that:
	- As a neutron star grows, an increasing fraction of its gravity is due to pressure;
	- As the rest mass of the neutron star exceeds X $\text{M}\odot$ (the gravitational mass exceeds Y $\text{M}\odot$), a quark-matter core forms;
	- When the gravitational mass grows to Z $\text{M}\odot$, the pressure gradient at the core's surface turns positive, and the neutron star collapses. It would collapse to a quark star, except that the radius drops below the Schwarzschild limit and produces a black hole whose gravitational mass is ~5.0 $\text{M}\odot$, thus producing the mass gap.
- In the next section, we examine the observational evidence for the existence of the mass gap and review prior work examining possible causes for the mass gap. Section 3 summarizes our hypothesis regarding the physics behind the mass gap and the approach taken to test the hypothesis. Section 4 details the model used to test the hypothesis and the results of the analysis. We end the paper with a summary of the results and its implications.
# 2. Mass Gap Observations
- Observations:
	- Very few objects in the 2.5-5.0 range. A statistically-significant gap.
	- Neutron stars in the 2.2-2.5 range have quark cores.
	- But no quark stars observed.
- Implication of observations: the explanation must show why objects in the mass gap are rare, but also why they are not precluded.
- Existing explanations
- Why we are offering an alternate rationale for the mass gap.
# 3. Hypothesis Summary
- A quick discussion of the difference between rest mass and gravitational mass; for remote objects, only gravitational mass can be observed.
- As the mass of an object grows, it both compresses the matter that comprises it *and*, if the pressure is high enough, breaks the structure of matter down to its components, compressing them.
	- Pure compression results in minimal reduction of radius; "pure" forms of matter (e.g., neutrons) do not compress much.
	- But the transition from a "higher" form of matter to "lower" (e.g., atoms to neutrons, or neutrons to quarks) produces a significant increase in density.
- A walk-through of the hypothesis: 
	- When a neutron star grows to a certain size, the pressure at its center collapses the neutrons into quarks.
	- When the quark core grows to a certain size, the xxx gradient at the core's surface becomes positive. The positive feedback results in the entire star abruptly collapsing to quark.
	- EXCEPT --- it crosses the Schwarzschild boundary and becomes a black star.
	- The increased gravitational mass, due to the reduced radius (increased pressure) increases the mass of the object to the top of the mass gap
- Rotation, but reducing the pressure, allows stars to grow more massive

# 5. Evaluation
- Show graphs for neutron stars. As the baryon mass grows, the observed mass grows faster.
- Show graphs for quark stars. They are not known to exist, but a quark star at a given baryon mass would have more observed mass than a neutron star with the same baryon mass.
- Show graphs for hybrid stars --- neutron stars with quark cores. Show that, for small neutron stars, there is no core, but the core grows as the neutron stars grow.
- Posit that spin will reduce the pressure, both preventing collapse but also reducing the pressure component of gravity, but adding some gravity due to the motion. Show that neutron stars in the mass gap have significant spin.
