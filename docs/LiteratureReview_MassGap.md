# Comprehensive Literature Review: Mass Gaps in Compact Objects

**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete review of mass gap phenomena, theoretical frameworks, and observational evidence  
**Scope:** Lower mass gap (2.5-5 M☉), upper mass gap (50-150 M☉), modeling approaches, and theoretical explanations

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive review examines two distinct mass gap phenomena in compact object astrophysics:

1. **Lower mass gap (2.5-5 M☉):** Scarcity of compact objects between the maximum neutron star mass and minimum black hole mass
2. **Upper mass gap (50-150 M☉):** Absence of black holes in the pair-instability supernova mass range

Both gaps represent fundamental puzzles in stellar evolution and compact object formation. This review examines:
- Observational evidence for both gaps
- Theoretical modeling frameworks (TOV equations, stellar evolution codes)
- Competing theoretical explanations
- Recent observations challenging traditional views
- Implications for fundamental physics

**Key findings:**
- Lower mass gap is well-established but being increasingly populated by LIGO/Virgo detections
- Upper mass gap shows hints of violations, suggesting complex physics
- TOV equations remain the gold standard for neutron star modeling
- Multiple mechanisms may contribute to gap formation
- Both gaps may reflect phase transitions in dense matter

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Historical Context

The study of compact object mass distributions has revealed two surprising "gaps"—mass ranges where few or no objects are observed. Understanding these gaps is crucial for theories of stellar evolution, supernova physics, and the nature of dense matter.

**The lower mass gap** was first identified systematically by Bailyn et al. (1998) through observations of X-ray binaries, showing a dearth of compact objects between approximately 2.5 and 5 solar masses. This gap sits precisely at the boundary between neutron stars and black holes, suggesting fundamental physics at play in the transition between these object types.

**The upper mass gap** emerged from theoretical predictions by Fowler & Hoyle (1964) and Heger & Woosley (2002), who calculated that stars in a certain mass range should undergo pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) that completely disrupt the star, leaving no remnant. This mechanism predicts an absence of black holes between roughly 50 and 150 M☉.

### 1.2 Significance

These gaps are not mere curiosities but windows into:
- **Fundamental physics:** Equation of state of supranuclear matter, quantum chromodynamics, general relativity
- **Stellar evolution:** Core collapse physics, explosion mechanisms, mass loss
- **Gravitational wave astronomy:** Population synthesis, merger rates, cosmological implications
- **Observational selection effects:** What we can detect vs. what exists

### 1.3 Scope of This Review

This review synthesizes observational evidence, theoretical frameworks, and proposed mechanisms for both mass gaps. We pay particular attention to:
- The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations as the foundation for neutron star modeling
- Recent gravitational wave observations that challenge traditional gap boundaries
- Multiple theoretical mechanisms that may contribute simultaneously
- Connections between the two gaps through fundamental physics

## 2. The Lower Mass Gap (2.5-5 M☉)

### 2.1 Historical Observations

#### 2.1.1 X-ray Binary Surveys

**Bailyn et al. (1998)** - *"The Mass Distribution of Stellar Black Holes"*
- Analyzed mass measurements from X-ray binaries containing compact objects
- Found clear bimodal distribution: neutron stars below ~2.5 M☉, black holes above ~5 M☉
- Original identification of the lower mass gap
- **Key quote:** "The distribution of measured masses suggests a genuine dearth of compact objects in the 2-5 M☉ range"

**Özel et al. (2010, 2012)** - *Systematic surveys*
- Compiled comprehensive catalogs of compact object masses
- Confirmed gap in galactic black hole population
- Maximum NS mass: ~2.0-2.5 M☉
- Minimum BH mass: ~5 M☉
- **Statistical significance:** Gap is significant at >3σ level

**Farr et al. (2011)** - *Bayesian Analysis*
- Applied sophisticated statistical methods to mass measurements
- Accounted for selection biases and measurement uncertainties
- Confirmed genuine bimodality rather than observational artifact
- **Finding:** Probability of continuous distribution <1%

#### 2.1.2 Radio Pulsar Measurements

High-precision neutron star masses from pulsar timing provide the upper boundary of the gap:

**Observed massive neutron stars:**
- PSR J0348+0432: 2.01 ± 0.04 M☉ (Antoniadis et al. 2013)
- PSR J0740+6620: 2.14 ± 0.10 M☉ (Cromartie et al. 2020)
- PSR J1614-2230: 1.97 ± 0.04 M☉ (Demorest et al. 2010)

These measurements establish that neutron stars can exist stably up to at least 2.14 M☉, likely representing the upper limit or very close to it.

**Theoretical maximum mass:**
- TOV calculations predict M_max ~ 2.0-2.5 M☉ depending on equation of state
- Causality constraint (speed of sound ≤ c) gives absolute upper limit ~3 M☉
- Observed masses consistent with theoretical predictions

### 2.2 Mass Gap Characteristics

**Boundaries:**
- **Lower boundary:** ~2.5 M☉ (maximum stable NS mass)
- **Upper boundary:** ~5 M☉ (minimum observed BH mass)
- **Width:** ~2.5 M☉
- **Depth:** Very few confirmed objects (pre-LIGO era: 0-2 candidates)

**Alternative definitions in literature:**
- Conservative: 3-5 M☉ (excludes most massive NSs)
- Broad: 2-5 M☉ (original Bailyn definition)
- Recent: 2.5-5 M☉ (consensus post-PSR J0740+6620)

### 2.3 Objects in the Gap

#### 2.3.1 Pre-LIGO Candidates

Very few objects were observed in the gap before gravitational wave detections:

**GRS 1915+105** (X-ray binary)
- Mass estimates: 10-18 M☉ (too massive, not in gap)
- Historically cited but now known to be heavier

**Cygnus X-3** (X-ray binary)
- Compact object mass: uncertain, possibly ~2-4 M☉
- Large uncertainties make gap membership unclear

**Key observation:** Genuine scarcity of objects in 2.5-5 M☉ range in electromagnetic observations

#### 2.3.2 LIGO/Virgo Era Detections

Gravitational wave observations have dramatically changed the picture:

**GW190814** (Abbott et al. 2020)
- **Most significant gap object**
- Merger: 23 M☉ black hole + 2.6 M☉ compact object
- Secondary mass: 2.59⁺⁰·⁰⁸₋₀.₀₉ M☉ (firmly in gap)
- **Key quote:** "GW190814's secondary mass lies in the hypothesized lower mass gap of 2.5–5 M⊙"
- **Interpretation uncertain:** Heaviest neutron star or lightest black hole?
- Mass ratio q = 0.112 (most extreme observed)

**GW190425** (Abbott et al. 2020)
- Binary neutron star merger
- Component masses: ~1.6-2.0 M☉ each
- Total mass: ~3.4 M☉
- Post-merger remnant: likely ~3-4 M☉ (in gap, but rapidly collapsed)

**Additional O3 candidates:**
- Multiple events with component masses 2.5-5 M☉
- Statistical analysis suggests gap is less pronounced than previously thought
- Some may be misidentified or have large uncertainties

### 2.4 Gap Properties and Evolution

**Time evolution:**
- Pre-2010: Well-established, few exceptions
- 2010-2015: Confirmed by systematic surveys
- 2015-2020: First LIGO detections begin to populate
- 2020-present: Multiple gap objects detected

**Current status:**
- Gap still exists but less pronounced
- May reflect mixture of physical mechanism + selection effects
- Gravitational waves probe different population than X-ray binaries

## 3. Neutron Star Modeling: The TOV Framework

### 3.1 Theoretical Foundation

#### 3.1.1 The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff Equation

The TOV equation is the cornerstone of neutron star modeling, derived from Einstein's field equations under assumptions of:
- Spherical symmetry
- Static configuration (no time dependence)
- Perfect fluid (no shear stress)

**Original derivations:**

**Tolman (1939)** - *"Static Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations for Spheres of Fluid"*
- First complete relativistic treatment of stellar structure
- Derived general equations for static spherically symmetric fluid spheres
- Showed how pressure contributes to spacetime curvature

**Oppenheimer & Volkoff (1939)** - *"On Massive Neutron Cores"*
- Applied Tolman's equations specifically to neutron stars
- Demonstrated maximum mass for neutron stars (~0.7 M☉ with primitive EOS)
- Established that GR effects crucial for neutron stars
- **Key insight:** Pressure acts as gravitational source, limiting maximum mass

#### 3.1.2 The TOV Equations

**Structure equations:**

```
dP/dr = -(G/r²)[ρ(r) + P(r)/c²][M(r) + 4πr³P(r)/c²] / [1 - 2GM(r)/(rc²)]

dM/dr = 4πr²ρ(r)

dΦ/dr = -1/(ρ(r) + P(r)/c²) × dP/dr
```

Where:
- P(r) = pressure at radius r
- ρ(r) = mass-energy density at radius r
- M(r) = enclosed gravitational mass
- Φ(r) = metric function (related to gravitational redshift)
- G = gravitational constant
- c = speed of light

**Physical interpretation of pressure terms:**

1. **P/c² term (numerator, first bracket):**
   - Pressure contributes to effective mass-energy density
   - At nuclear densities, P/ρc² ~ 0.1-0.3
   - Significant contribution to gravitational field

2. **4πr³P/c² term (numerator, second bracket):**
   - Volume-integrated pressure adds to enclosed mass
   - Unique to general relativity (no Newtonian analog)
   - Becomes dominant near stellar center

3. **2GM/rc² term (denominator):**
   - General relativistic correction factor
   - Related to gravitational redshift
   - Approaches singularity at Schwarzschild radius
   - Limits how compact objects can be

**Critical insight:** Unlike Newtonian gravity where pressure only resists compression, in GR pressure is itself a source of gravity. This creates a self-limiting mechanism: adding pressure to support against collapse actually increases gravity, eventually making further support impossible.

### 3.2 Equation of State Requirements

#### 3.2.1 EOS Role

The TOV equations must be supplemented with an equation of state (EOS) relating pressure to density:

```
P = P(ρ)  or  P = P(ρ, T, Y_e, ...)
```

For cold catalyzed matter (T ~ 0), composition in beta equilibrium, EOS simplifies to P(ρ).

**Physical regimes:**

1. **ρ < ρ₀ (sub-nuclear):** ρ₀ ~ 2.8 × 10¹⁴ g/cm³
   - Well-understood nuclear physics
   - Various theoretical models agree
   - Dominated by neutron drip, nuclear pasta phases

2. **ρ ~ ρ₀ to 3ρ₀ (nuclear):**
   - Moderately uncertain
   - Constrained by nuclear experiments
   - Multiple viable models (APR, FPS, SLy, etc.)

3. **ρ > 3ρ₀ (supranuclear):**
   - Highly uncertain
   - Possible phase transitions
   - Quark deconfinement, hyperons, condensates
   - Direct experimental access impossible

#### 3.2.2 EOS Classes

**Nucleonic EOS:**
- Based on nucleon-nucleon interactions
- Examples: APR (Akmal-Pandharipande-Ravenhall), SLy (Skyrme Lyon)
- Predict M_max ~ 2.0-2.5 M☉
- No exotic matter

**Hyperonic EOS:**
- Includes hyperons (Λ, Σ, Ξ)
- "Hyperon puzzle": softens EOS, reduces M_max
- Tension with 2+ M☉ observations
- Requires strong hyperon-nucleon repulsion to match data

**Quark EOS:**
- Deconfined quark matter at high density
- MIT bag model: P = (ρc² - 4B)/3
- Vector interaction enhanced models
- Can explain massive neutron stars if stiff enough

**Hybrid EOS:**
- Nuclear matter + quark core
- Phase transition at intermediate density
- Most realistic for massive neutron stars
- Annala et al. (2020) evidence for quark cores in massive NSs

### 3.3 Stability Analysis

#### 3.3.1 Maximum Mass Determination

Not every TOV solution represents a stable star. Stability requires:

**Static stability criterion:**
```
dM/dρ_c > 0
```

Where ρ_c is central density. This condition means:
- Increasing central density increases gravitational mass → stable
- Decreasing central density increases mass → unstable

**Physical interpretation:**
- On stable branch: adding matter makes star more massive (as expected)
- At maximum mass: dM/dρ_c = 0 (turning point)
- On unstable branch: adding matter makes star lighter (paradoxical → unstable)

**Chandrasekhar stability criterion:**
- Related to adiabatic index Γ = (d ln P)/(d ln ρ)
- Stability requires Γ > 4/3 for relativistic stars
- More restrictive than static criterion for realistic EOS

#### 3.3.2 Instability Mechanism

**Why there's a maximum mass:**

1. **Pressure increases gravity:** Additional pressure supports against collapse BUT also increases gravitational field
2. **Self-limiting:** At some point, pressure-induced gravity exceeds pressure support
3. **Unstable equilibrium:** Beyond M_max, no static equilibrium possible
4. **Collapse ensues:** Star must collapse to black hole

**Mathematical description:**

Near maximum mass, the TOV equation shows:
```
dP/dr ∝ [stuff] / [1 - 2GM/(rc²)]
```

As M → M_max:
- Denominator approaches zero for some radius
- Pressure gradient becomes infinite
- No solution with finite pressure exists
- Signals onset of gravitational collapse

### 3.4 Modern TOV Implementations

#### 3.4.1 Numerical Methods

**Standard approach:**
1. Choose EOS: P(ρ), ε(ρ)
2. Pick central density ρ_c
3. Integrate TOV equations from center outward
4. Stop when P → 0 (stellar surface)
5. Read off M_total, R_total
6. Repeat for different ρ_c to get M(R) relation

**Integration methods:**
- Runge-Kutta (RK4, RK45): Standard choice
- Adaptive step size: Essential near surface where P changes rapidly
- High precision required: Errors accumulate over ~10 km

**Practical considerations:**
- Central boundary conditions: P(0) = P_c, M(0) = 0
- Surface definition: P(R) = 0 or some small cutoff
- Stability check: Compute dM/dρ_c numerically

#### 3.4.2 Validation Procedures

**Essential tests for any TOV solver:**

1. **Analytical solutions:** 
   - Tolman VII (exact solution for specific EOS)
   - Should match to <0.1% error

2. **Known EOS:**
   - APR, SLy, etc. have published M(R) curves
   - Compare to literature values
   - Check M_max, R(1.4 M☉), etc.

3. **Newtonian limit:**
   - Low compactness (M/R → 0)
   - Should reproduce Newtonian results
   - c → ∞ in TOV equations

4. **Causality:**
   - Maximum mass with causal EOS (c_s ≤ c)
   - Should be ~3 M☉ (Rhoades & Ruffini 1974)

5. **Code comparison:**
   - Independent implementations
   - Different numerical methods
   - Should agree to <0.1%

**Lattimer & Prakash (2001)** - *Comprehensive review*
- Standard reference for TOV calculations
- Provides benchmark results for multiple EOS
- Discusses systematic uncertainties
- Establishes expected ranges for NS properties

### 3.5 Constraints from Observations

#### 3.5.1 Maximum Mass Constraints

**Direct measurements:**
- PSR J0740+6620: M = 2.14 ± 0.10 M☉ → M_max ≥ 2.14 M☉
- PSR J0348+0432: M = 2.01 ± 0.04 M☉ → M_max ≥ 2.01 M☉
- Combined: M_max ≥ 2.0 M☉ at high confidence

**Implications for EOS:**
- Rules out soft EOS (many hyperonic models)
- Requires relatively stiff nuclear matter
- Constrains high-density behavior

#### 3.5.2 Radius Constraints

**NICER observations** (Miller et al. 2019, Riley et al. 2019)
- PSR J0030+0451: R = 12.71⁺¹·¹⁴₋₁.₁₉ km (M = 1.34 M☉)
- PSR J0740+6620: R = 12.35⁺⁰·⁷⁵₋₀.₈₁ km (M = 2.08 M☉)
- Favor relatively stiff EOS
- Constrain M-R relation

**Gravitational waves** (Abbott et al. 2017, GW170817)
- Tidal deformability: Λ̃ = 300⁺⁴²⁰₋₂₃₀
- Rules out very stiff EOS
- Radius constraint: R(1.4 M☉) = 11-13 km
- Combined with mass measurements: powerful EOS constraints

### 3.6 Extensions and Limitations

#### 3.6.1 What TOV Doesn't Include

**Rotation:**
- TOV assumes static configuration
- Real pulsars rotate (fastest: ~700 Hz)
- Rotation increases M_max by ~10-20%
- Requires 2D/3D numerical relativity

**Magnetic fields:**
- Strong fields (>10¹⁵ G) affect structure
- Magnetars have extreme fields
- Can affect M_max, stability
- Generally small effect except for magnetars

**Temperature:**
- TOV assumes T = 0 (cold matter)
- Proto-neutron stars have T ~ 10-50 MeV
- Thermal pressure supports temporarily
- NS cools quickly (<1 minute to thermal pressure negligible)

**Time dependence:**
- Core collapse, mergers are dynamic
- TOV gives final equilibrium state
- Formation process requires full GR hydro simulations

#### 3.6.2 Rotating Star Equations

For rotating neutron stars, must solve full Einstein equations in axisymmetry:

**Approaches:**
1. **Slow rotation approximation:** Perturbative correction to TOV
2. **Hartle-Thorne formalism:** Systematic expansion in Ω
3. **Fully general:** 2D/3D numerical relativity codes

**Key results:**
- M_max(rotating) ~ 1.2 × M_max(static)
- Centrifugal support crucial for fastest pulsars
- Spin-down → eventual collapse possible (e.g., recycled pulsars)

**Computational tools:**
- RNS code (Stergioulas & Friedman 1995)
- LORENE (Bonazzola et al. 1998)
- Various GR magnetohydrodynamics codes

### 3.7 Alternative EOS Constraints

#### 3.7.1 Bayesian Inference Approaches

**Modern methodology** (Steiner et al. 2013, 2018; Annala et al. 2020, 2023)

Rather than assuming specific EOS forms, use Bayesian inference:

1. **Parameterize EOS space:**
   - Piecewise polytropes
   - Spectral decomposition
   - Speed of sound representation

2. **Apply constraints:**
   - Observed masses (M > 2 M☉)
   - Observed radii (NICER)
   - Tidal deformability (GW170817)
   - Nuclear theory at low density
   - Causality at high density

3. **Infer probability distributions:**
   - P(ρ) for all densities
   - M_max probability distribution
   - Phase transition likelihood

**Annala et al. (2020, 2023) findings:**
- **Evidence for phase transition** to deconfined quark matter
- Occurs in cores of maximally massive neutron stars
- Density ~5-10 ρ₀
- Strong model-independent evidence

**Interpretation:** Maximum mass neutron stars likely have quark matter cores, representing beginning of transition to next phase (Tier 2 in BHEM terminology).

#### 3.7.2 QCD-based EOS

**Ab initio calculations:**

**Perturbative QCD** (Kurkela et al. 2010; Gorda et al. 2018, 2023)
- Valid at asymptotically high density (ρ → ∞)
- N3LO precision calculations
- Problem: NS cores not in perturbative regime

**Lattice QCD**
- Non-perturbative numerical simulations
- Limitations: Sign problem at finite density
- Recent progress: Taylor expansion methods
- Not yet applicable to full NS density range

**Combined approach:**
- Nuclear theory at ρ ≲ ρ₀
- Interpolation through uncertain regime
- pQCD at ρ ≫ ρ₀
- Bayesian matching

**Result:** Model-independent constraints on EOS across all densities relevant for neutron stars.

## 4. The Upper Mass Gap (50-150 M☉)

### 4.1 Theoretical Foundation: Pair-Instability Supernovae

#### 4.1.1 Physical Mechanism

**Fowler & Hoyle (1964)** - Original prediction
- During late stellar evolution, core temperatures reach T ~ 10⁹ K
- High-energy photons create electron-positron pairs: γ → e⁺ + e⁻
- Pair production removes energy from photon field
- Reduces radiation pressure supporting star
- Core becomes gravitationally unstable

**Detailed process:**

1. **Helium core burning** (stars >60 M☉)
   - Core mass ~40-60 M☉ after mass loss
   - Core temperature rises above ~2 × 10⁹ K
   - Pair production becomes energetically favorable

2. **Pressure drop:**
   - Photons at kT ~ MeV energies create pairs
   - Energy goes into rest mass: E = 2m_e c² = 1.02 MeV
   - Radiation pressure: P_rad ∝ aT⁴
   - Drop in T → drop in pressure
   - Adiabatic index: Γ = (∂ ln P/∂ ln ρ) drops below 4/3

3. **Dynamical instability:**
   - Core contracts rapidly
   - Oxygen burning ignites explosively
   - Releases ~10⁵¹ erg (typical supernova)
   - BUT: Entire star disrupted, no remnant

4. **Complete disruption:**
   - Unlike normal core collapse, no remnant forms
   - All stellar matter ejected
   - No black hole formation
   - Gap in remnant mass distribution

#### 4.1.2 Mass Range Calculation

**Heger & Woosley (2002)** - Comprehensive study
- Stellar evolution calculations for massive stars
- Included mass loss, rotation, metallicity

**Results:**

```
M_ZAMS (solar masses) → Outcome

30-40    → Iron core collapse → BH (40-50 M☉ depending on mass loss)
40-65    → Pulsational pair instability → BH
65-130   → Pair instability SN → Complete disruption (no remnant)
130-250  → Photodisintegration → Direct collapse → BH
>250     → Direct collapse → BH
```

**Gap characteristics:**
- **Lower boundary:** ~50 M☉ (depending on metallicity, mass loss)
- **Upper boundary:** ~130-150 M☉ 
- **Width:** ~80-100 M☉
- **Depth:** Complete (theoretically no objects)

**Metallicity dependence:**
- Low Z: Less mass loss → wider gap
- Solar Z: Substantial mass loss → narrower gap, shifts to lower masses
- Very low Z (Pop III): Gap could extend 60-150 M☉

#### 4.1.3 Pulsational Pair Instability (PPI)

**Woosley (2017)** - Detailed PPI models

**Mechanism:**
1. Star reaches pair instability threshold
2. Core contracts, oxygen ignites
3. Explosion NOT strong enough to disrupt star
4. Outer layers ejected, core survives
5. Star contracts again, process repeats
6. Multiple pulses over ~10,000 years
7. Eventually: complete disruption OR final collapse

**Mass loss:**
- Each pulse ejects several solar masses
- Total mass loss: 10-30 M☉
- Shifts final BH mass downward
- Creates structure at lower edge of gap

**Observable signatures:**
- Precursor transients years before final explosion
- Complex light curves
- Possible example: SN 2006gy (very luminous, possible PPI)

### 4.2 Observational Evidence

#### 4.2.1 Stellar-Mass Black Holes (pre-LIGO)

**Electromagnetic observations:**
- X-ray binaries: Sample limited, mostly <20 M☉
- Few systems with M > 30 M☉
- Selection effects: Massive BHs less likely in detectable binaries
- **No confirmed BHs in 50-150 M☉ range**

**Challenges:**
- Massive BHs receive large natal kicks → ejected from binaries
- No accretion disk → no X-ray emission
- Difficult to detect isolated massive BHs

#### 4.2.2 LIGO/Virgo Observations

**GW150914** (Abbott et al. 2016) - First detection
- Masses: 36⁺⁵₋₄ M☉ and 29⁺⁴₋₄ M☉
- Combined: 62⁺⁴₋₄ M☉ (final BH after merger)
- **Significance:** Components in or near PISN gap
- Initial surprise: More massive than expected from X-ray binaries

**GW170729** (Abbott et al. 2019)
- Most massive BBH merger in O1/O2
- Primary mass: 50.6⁺¹⁶·⁶₋₁₀.₂ M☉
- **Right at gap edge**
- Large uncertainties due to distance/orientation

**GW190521** (Abbott et al. 2020) - **Most significant**
- **Primary mass: 85⁺²¹₋₁₄ M☉ (firmly in gap!)**
- Secondary mass: 66⁺¹⁷₋₁₈ M☉
- Final black hole: 142⁺²⁸₋₁₆ M☉ (intermediate mass)
- **Key finding:** "If the primary black hole was formed through astrophysical channels, it is in the pair-instability mass gap"
- Multiple possible interpretations

**Additional O3 detections:**
- GW190602: Primary ~65 M☉ (near gap)
- GW190403: Component masses ~30-45 M☉
- Multiple events pushing against PISN boundaries

#### 4.2.3 Population Studies

**Abbott et al. (2021)** - GWTC-3 population analysis
- 90 confident BBH mergers through O3
- Mass distribution shows:
  - Peak at ~10 M☉
  - Extended tail to ~50 M☉
  - **Possible pile-up at gap edges**
  - Few events clearly in gap

**Fitting models:**
- Power law + peak model
- Multi-component models
- Some fits show suppression at 50-120 M☉
- Others show continuous distribution

**Statistical significance:**
- Gap may exist but less dramatic than predicted
- OR formation in gap possible through alternative channels
- Need more detections for definitive answer

### 4.3 Gap Violations: Possible Explanations

#### 4.3.1 Hierarchical Mergers

**Concept:** Black holes can grow through successive mergers

**Mechanism:**
1. First generation: 30-40 M☉ BHs form from stars
2. Merge in dense environment → 60-80 M☉ BH
3. Merge again → exceed gap
4. Can build up masses arbitrarily

**Requirements:**
- Dense stellar environments (globular clusters, nuclear star clusters)
- High merger rates
- Retention of merger products
- Multiple generations possible within Hubble time

**Observational signatures:**
- Higher-generation BHs have effective spins
- First-generation BHs from isolated binaries: low spins
- GW190521: Spins consistent with hierarchical formation

**Fishbach et al. (2017), Gerosa & Berti (2017):**
- Hierarchical mergers can populate gap
- Requires specific dynamical environments
- Predicts correlation between mass and spin

#### 4.3.2 Stellar Rotation and Mixing

**Fuller & Ma (2019), Marchant et al. (2019)**

**Key insight:** Stellar models typically assume minimal rotation

**Effects of rapid rotation:**
1. **Enhanced mixing:** Brings fresh hydrogen to core
2. **Extended lifetime:** Core hydrogen burning lasts longer
3. **Larger helium cores:** More massive at time of collapse
4. **Reduced mass loss:** Centrifugal support reduces stellar winds

**Result:**
- Stars can produce larger BHs than in non-rotating models
- Gap boundaries shift to higher masses
- May fill in lower part of gap (50-80 M☉)

**Chemically homogeneous evolution:**
- Extreme mixing → no distinct core/envelope
- Different evolutionary path
- Can produce very massive stellar BHs directly
- Requires high metallicity and rapid rotation

#### 4.3.3 Fallback Accretion

**Mechanism:**
Even if PISN initiates, not all material may escape:

1. Central regions explode
2. Outer layers initially expelled
3. Gravitational pull from inner regions
4. Some material falls back
5. Accretion onto compact remnant

**Leung et al. (2019), Farmer et al. (2020):**
- 3D simulations show asymmetric explosions
- Fallback can leave remnants even from PISN
- Mass of remnant: 10-50 M☉ possible
- Creates lower-mass objects in gap

**Uncertainties:**
- Depends on explosion energy
- Sensitive to initial conditions
- Difficult to simulate accurately

#### 4.3.4 Alternative Formation Channels

**Primordial black holes:**
- Formed in early universe (not from stars)
- Could have any mass
- Would naturally populate gap
- Constraints from microlensing, CMB

**Dynamical capture in AGN disks:**
- Black holes in accretion disk around supermassive BH
- Accrete gas → grow beyond PISN limits
- Multiple generations of mergers
- Can explain GW190521

**Direct collapse:**
- Very massive stars (>260 M☉) bypass PISN
- Photodisintegration prevents pair instability
- Direct collapse to BH
- Possible in low-metallicity environments

## 5. Theoretical Explanations for the Lower Gap

### 5.1 Supernova Explosion Mechanisms

#### 5.1.1 Neutrino-Driven Winds

**Standard core collapse scenario:**

1. **Iron core collapse:** M_core ~ 1.3-2.0 M☉
2. **Bounce and shock:** Shock stalls at ~200 km
3. **Neutrino heating:** Revives shock after ~0.1-1 s
4. **Explosion:** Ejects envelope, leaves NS or BH

**Gap formation mechanism:**

**Fryer & Kalogera (2001), Fryer et al. (2012)**
- **Weak explosions** (E ~ 10⁵⁰ erg): Leave NS (~1.3-2.0 M☉)
- **Failed explosions:** Weak/no shock, fallback → BH (~5-15 M☉)
- **Gap:** Intermediate cases (partial fallback → 2.5-5 M☉) rare

**Physical explanation:**
- Explosion energy bimodal distribution
- Either successful (NS) or failed (BH)
- Intermediate outcomes dynamically unstable

**Predictions:**
- Gap at 2.5-5 M☉
- NS maximum mass set by TOV limit
- BH minimum mass set by initial core mass + fallback

#### 5.1.2 Fallback and Accretion

**Belczynski et al. (2012)** - Population synthesis

**Mechanism:**
1. Supernova explosion begins
2. Shock ejects inner layers
3. Gravity pulls back outer envelope
4. Proto-NS accretes fallback material
5. If M_total > M_max → collapses to BH

**Key parameters:**
- Fallback amount depends on:
  - Explosion energy
  - Progenitor structure  
  - Core mass

**Bimodal outcome:**
- **Low fallback:** NS survives (~1.3-2.5 M☉)
- **High fallback:** Exceeds M_max → collapse to BH (>5 M☉)
- **Intermediate:** Dynamically unstable, rare

**Gap width:**
- ΔM ~ M_initial - M_max ~ 5 - 2.5 = 2.5 M☉
- Consistent with observations

#### 5.1.3 Failed Supernovae

**Kochanek (2014), Adams et al. (2017)**

**Key concept:** Some stars don't explode successfully

**Observational evidence:**
- N6946-BH1: Red supergiant disappeared, no SN (Adams et al. 2017)
- Possible failed SN candidates in archival data
- Rate: ~10-30% of core collapses

**Mechanism:**
1. Core collapse occurs
2. Shock stalls permanently
3. Entire star falls into proto-BH
4. Weak transient (faint, short duration)
5. Leaves BH with M ~ M_core + M_envelope

**Mass distribution:**
- Failed SNe: M_prog ~ 15-25 M☉ → M_BH ~ 5-10 M☉
- Successful SNe: M_prog ~ 8-15 M☉ → M_NS ~ 1.3-2.0 M☉
- Gap between populations

### 5.2 Maximum Neutron Star Mass

#### 5.2.1 TOV Limit Determines Lower Boundary

**Physical mechanism:**

The maximum stable neutron star mass is determined by the TOV equations and the nuclear equation of state:

1. **Stiff EOS** (strong nuclear repulsion):
   - Higher M_max (~2.5 M☉)
   - Can support more mass before collapse

2. **Soft EOS** (weak repulsion):
   - Lower M_max (~1.8 M☉)
   - Collapses at lower mass

**Observational constraints:**
- M_max ≥ 2.08 M☉ (PSR J0740+6620)
- Likely M_max ~ 2.2-2.5 M☉
- Sets lower boundary of mass gap

**Transition to black hole:**
- Any NS exceeding M_max must collapse
- Collapse likely rapid (<1 s)
- Forms BH with M ~ M_NS initially
- Then accretes envelope material

#### 5.2.2 Quark Matter Phase Transition

**Annala et al. (2020, 2023)** - Evidence for quark cores

**Hypothesis:** Maximum NS mass corresponds to onset of quark deconfinement

**Physical picture:**
1. **Below 2 M☉:** Pure nuclear matter, stable
2. **2-2.5 M☉:** Mixed phase, quark core beginning
3. **>2.5 M☉:** Large quark core, unstable to collapse

**Phase transition effects:**

**Softening of EOS:**
- Quark matter typically softer than nuclear matter
- Reduces M_max
- Creates instability

**First-order transition:**
- Density discontinuity at transition
- Can create mixed-phase region
- "Twin stars" possible (same M, different R)

**Continuous crossover:**
- Smooth transition
- Still creates maximum mass
- More consistent with observations

**BHEM interpretation:**
- Quark core formation = Tier 1 → Tier 2 transition
- Large quark cores unstable
- Collapse triggered when quark core reaches critical size

### 5.3 Pressure Contributions to Gravitational Mass

#### 5.3.1 Theoretical Framework

**Fundamental GR result:** Pressure is a source of gravity

**Tolman (1939), Oppenheimer & Volkoff (1939):**

In the TOV equation:
```
M_grav = M_rest + M_pressure

Where: M_pressure = 4π ∫₀^R [P(r)/c²] r² dr
```

**Physical interpretation:**
- M_rest: Baryon rest mass
- M_pressure: Additional gravitational mass from pressure
- Pressure energy E = PV contributes via E/c² = M

**Magnitude:**
For typical neutron stars:
- M_pressure ~ 0.1-0.3 M☉
- Ratio: M_pressure/M_rest ~ 5-15%

For quark stars (higher pressure):
- M_pressure ~ 0.3-0.8 M☉
- Ratio: M_pressure/M_rest ~ 15-30%

#### 5.3.2 Gap Explanation via Pressure

**Hypothesis (BHEM theory):**

**Mechanism:**
1. Neutron star at M_grav = 2.5 M☉, M_rest = 2.2 M☉
2. Approaches instability → quark core forms
3. Radius decreases: R_quark ~ 0.5 R_neutron
4. Central pressure increases dramatically: P ∝ M²/R⁴
5. Pressure contribution increases: M_pressure: 0.3 → 0.8 M☉
6. Gravitational mass jumps: M_grav: 2.5 → 3.0 M☉

**BUT:** Object inside Schwarzschild radius → collapses to BH

**Key insight:**
- Jump in M_grav due to pressure occurs during transition
- Transition state is unstable
- Final state is BH with M ~ 5 M☉ (includes envelope)
- No stable configurations exist in 2.5-5 M☉ range

**Quantitative prediction:**
- If M_pressure can increase by ~0.5-2 M☉ during quark transition
- AND transition triggered near TOV maximum
- THEN expect gap at observed location

**Testing:**
- Calculate M_pressure for nuclear vs. quark EOS
- Use realistic pressure profiles
- Check if ΔM_pressure ~ 2-3 M☉ achievable

**Manca et al. (2014)** - Neo-Newtonian models
- Including pressure in Newtonian gravity
- Reproduces key GR effects
- Confirms pressure amplifies gravity
- Shows maximum mass emergence

**Will (1976)** - Kreuzer experiment reinterpretation
- Experimental confirmation that pressure couples to gravity
- Tests P/c² contribution to gravitational field
- Result consistent with GR (no anomalous coupling)

#### 5.3.3 Connection to Observations

**GW190814 (2.6 M☉ object):**

**Possible interpretations:**

1. **Massive NS:**
   - M_rest ~ 2.3-2.4 M☉
   - M_pressure ~ 0.2-0.3 M☉
   - M_grav = 2.6 M☉
   - Requires very stiff EOS

2. **Light BH:**
   - Formed from NS that exceeded M_max
   - Original M_rest ~ 2.2 M☉
   - Accreted or merged → 2.6 M☉
   - First object to "leak" into gap

3. **Quark star:**
   - M_rest ~ 2.0-2.2 M☉
   - Large quark core
   - M_pressure ~ 0.4-0.6 M☉ (from high P)
   - M_grav = 2.6 M☉ observed

**Distinguishing scenarios:**
- Tidal deformability (from GW signal)
- Merger remnant properties
- Population statistics

---

## 6. Theoretical Explanations for the Upper Gap

### 6.1 Pair-Instability Supernova Physics

#### 6.1.1 Detailed Mechanism

**Thermal evolution of massive cores:**

**Pre-PISN:**
- Helium core M_He ~ 40-60 M☉
- Silicon and oxygen burning
- Core temperature T ~ 1-3 × 10⁹ K
- Radiation pressure dominant: P_rad ∝ aT⁴

**Pair production threshold:**
- E_photon ~ kT ~ 2m_e c² = 1.02 MeV
- γ → e⁺ + e⁻ becomes favorable
- Pairs thermalize quickly
- Energy removed from radiation field

**Thermodynamic consequences:**

Adiabatic index: Γ = (∂ ln P / ∂ ln ρ)_s

- Pre-pair production: Γ ~ 4/3 (radiation-dominated)
- During pair production: Γ drops below 4/3
- **Dynamical instability:** Γ < 4/3 → gravitational collapse

**Oxygen ignition:**
- Core contracts rapidly
- Density increases, temperature rises
- Explosive oxygen burning: ¹⁶O + ¹⁶O → ...
- Energy release: ~10⁵¹-10⁵² erg
- Nickel production: ⁵⁶Ni (radioactive)

**Complete disruption:**
- Explosion energy exceeds binding energy
- All material ejected
- No compact remnant forms
- Fireball expands, cools, emits light

#### 6.1.2 Mass Range Boundaries

**Lower boundary (~50-65 M☉):**

**Pulsational regime:**
- Lighter cores undergo pulsations, not disruption
- Each pulse ejects mass
- Eventually either disrupts or collapses
- Creates complex boundary

**Factors affecting lower limit:**
- Metallicity (mass loss)
- Rotation (mixing)
- Binary evolution
- Initial mass function

**Upper boundary (~130-150 M☉):**

**Photodisintegration regime:**
- Very massive cores: M_He > 60-65 M☉
- Temperatures exceed ~3 × 10⁹ K
- Photodisintegration: γ + ⁵⁶Fe → 13⁴He + 4n
- Endothermic: absorbs energy
- Prevents explosive oxygen burning
- Direct collapse to massive BH instead

**Woosley et al. (2007):**
- Detailed calculations of boundary
- Depends on core mass, composition
- Sharp transition from PISN to direct collapse

#### 6.1.3 Metallicity Dependence

**Mass loss effects:**

**High metallicity (solar):**
- Strong stellar winds (line-driven)
- Massive stars lose 30-50% of mass
- Lower final He core mass
- Gap shifts to lower masses: ~40-100 M☉

**Low metallicity (Pop III):**
- Weak winds (less metal lines)
- Minimal mass loss
- Large He cores
- Gap extends: 60-150 M☉

**Very low Z:**
- First stars (Z = 0)
- No mass loss
- Gap fully realized
- Important for early universe

**Heger & Woosley (2002), Belczynski et al. (2016):**
- Population synthesis with metallicity
- Modern stellar populations: gap at ~50-120 M☉
- Low-Z: gap at ~60-150 M☉

### 6.2 Pulsational Pair Instability

#### 6.2.1 Physical Process

**Woosley (2017), Marchant & Moriya (2020)**

**Stages:**

1. **First pulse:**
   - Core reaches pair instability
   - Partial oxygen burning
   - Energy released insufficient for disruption
   - Outer layers ejected: ΔM ~ 5-10 M☉

2. **Quiescence:**
   - Core contracts again
   - Hydrogen/helium shell burning continues
   - Duration: 10²-10⁴ years

3. **Subsequent pulses:**
   - Process repeats
   - Each pulse ejects more mass
   - Core mass gradually decreases

4. **Final fate:**
   - **Option A:** Complete disruption (PISN)
   - **Option B:** Core too small, collapses to BH
   - **Result:** BH mass lower than initial core mass

**Mass loss:**
- Total mass ejected: 10-30 M☉
- Number of pulses: 2-10
- Final BH mass: 30-50 M☉ (even if started at 65 M☉)

**Observable signatures:**
- **Precursor transients:** Months to years before final event
- **Variable luminosity:** Multiple outbursts
- **Unusual spectra:** Mix of elements from different burning stages

**Possible examples:**
- SN 2006gy: Very luminous, long-lasting
- SN 2009ip: Multiple outbursts over years
- SN 2016aps: Extremely energetic

#### 6.2.2 Gap Structure

**PPI creates complex gap structure:**

**60-65 M☉ region:**
- Border between pulsational and full PISN
- Sensitive to initial conditions
- Some objects form BHs after pulses

**~65-130 M☉:**
- Full pair instability
- Complete disruption
- No remnants

**Lower edge softening:**
- PPI can create BHs at 40-60 M☉
- Reduces gap depth at lower boundary
- Explains some observations near 50 M☉

### 6.3 Hierarchical Formation

#### 6.3.1 Dense Stellar Environments

**Globular clusters:**

**Properties:**
- Stellar density: 10³-10⁶ stars/pc³
- Central relaxation time: 10⁷-10⁹ years
- Many stellar-mass BHs
- Dynamical interactions frequent

**Formation mechanism:**
1. First-generation BHs: 10-40 M☉ from stars
2. Form binaries through three-body encounters
3. Merge via GW emission
4. Product BH: 20-80 M☉
5. Remains in cluster (low velocity)
6. Can merge again → 40-160 M☉

**Gerosa & Berti (2017), Rodriguez et al. (2018):**
- N-body simulations of cluster dynamics
- ~10-50% of mergers involve previous merger products
- Can efficiently populate gap
- Predicts specific spin and mass distributions

**Nuclear star clusters:**
- Even denser than globular clusters
- Near galactic centers
- Higher merger rates
- Comparable or higher efficiency

#### 6.3.2 Spin Signatures

**Fundamental prediction:**

**First-generation BHs:**
- Form from isolated stellar evolution
- Spins: Low to moderate (|χ| ~ 0-0.3)
- Aligned with orbital angular momentum
- From stellar core rotation

**Second-generation BHs:**
- Merger products
- Spins: Can be high (|χ| ~ 0-0.7)
- Misaligned (isotropic distribution)
- From merger dynamics

**GW190521 analysis:**
- Component spins not well constrained
- Some evidence for precession
- Consistent with hierarchical scenario

**Population-level tests:**
- Compare mass and spin distributions
- Look for correlation
- LIGO/Virgo accumulating statistics

**Fishbach & Holz (2017):**
- Bayesian framework for hierarchical inference
- Can distinguish formation channels
- Requires ~100+ detections for confident measurement

#### 6.3.3 Retention and Escape Velocities

**Critical issue:** Do merger products stay in cluster?

**Escape velocity:**
- Globular cluster: v_esc ~ 30-50 km/s
- Nuclear cluster: v_esc ~ 100-300 km/s

**Merger kicks:**
- GW emission asymmetry
- Typical kicks: v_kick ~ 100-300 km/s
- Can eject product from cluster

**Probability of retention:**
- Depends on cluster mass, density
- Massive clusters: Higher retention
- Compact clusters: Higher v_esc

**Rodriguez et al. (2019):**
- Monte Carlo cluster simulations
- Retention probability: 10-70%
- Depends on cluster parameters
- Multiple generations possible in massive clusters

### 6.4 Alternative Formation Channels

#### 6.4.1 AGN Disk Formation

**McKernan et al. (2012, 2018), Stone et al. (2017)**

**Scenario:**

**Environment:**
- Accretion disk around supermassive BH
- Gas disk mass: 10⁴-10⁶ M☉
- Embedded stellar-mass BHs

**Formation mechanism:**
1. BHs born in star formation within disk
2. Or captured from nuclear star cluster
3. Migrate through disk
4. Form binaries in migration traps
5. Merge via gas drag and GW

**Growth:**
- Gas accretion: ΔM ~ 0.1-10 M☉
- Multiple mergers possible
- Can exceed PISN gap

**Predictions:**
- High mass ratios possible
- Retrograde orbits (relative to SMBH)
- Electromagnetic counterparts (from gas)

**Applicability to GW190521:**
- Can explain 85 M☉ + 66 M☉ merger
- Provides growth mechanism
- Predicts EM counterpart (claimed, controversial)

#### 6.4.2 Primordial Black Holes

**Carr & Hawking (1974), Carr (2020)**

**Formation:**
- Density fluctuations in early universe (t ~ 10⁻²⁰ s)
- Overdense regions collapse directly
- No stellar evolution involved
- Mass set by horizon mass at formation time

**Mass spectrum:**
- Can have any mass
- Naturally populate PISN gap
- No theoretical gap

**Constraints:**
- CMB: f_PBH < 10⁻⁴ for M ~ 100 M☉
- Microlensing: f_PBH < 10⁻² for M ~ 10-100 M☉
- Dynamical: f_PBH < 10⁻³ in our galaxy

**Likelihood:**
- PBHs very constrained
- Unlikely to dominate LIGO detections
- But can't be completely ruled out

#### 6.4.3 Direct Collapse Black Holes

**Very massive stars (>260 M☉):**

**Formation:**
- Low metallicity environments
- Minimal mass loss
- Runaway accretion possible

**Evolution:**
1. Core mass exceeds ~130 M☉
2. Photodisintegration instead of pair instability
3. γ + ⁵⁶Fe → 13⁴He + 4n (endothermic)
4. Energy absorbed, no explosion
5. Direct collapse to BH

**Result:**
- BH mass ≈ stellar mass
- Can be 130-1000+ M☉
- Exceeds gap naturally

**Likelihood:**
- Requires special conditions
- More relevant in early universe (Pop III)
- Unclear if occurs in modern stellar populations

## 7. Recent Observational Challenges

### 7.1 Lower Gap Population

#### 7.1.1 LIGO/Virgo O3 Results

**Abbott et al. (2021) - GWTC-3**

**Key observations:**

**GW190814:**
- 23 M☉ + 2.59 M☉ merger
- Secondary clearly in lower gap
- Either heaviest NS or lightest BH
- **Implication:** Gap not absolute

**GW190425:**
- Binary NS merger
- Component masses: 1.6-2.0 M☉
- Total: ~3.4 M☉
- Remnant briefly in gap before collapse
- **Implication:** Objects can enter gap dynamically

**Additional candidates:**
- Several events with component masses 2.5-4 M☉
- Large uncertainties in some cases
- Statistical analysis ongoing

#### 7.1.2 Population Inference

**Talbot & Thrane (2018), Fishbach et al. (2020)**

**Methods:**
- Hierarchical Bayesian inference
- Models mass distribution: dN/dM
- Tests for gaps, peaks, cutoffs

**Results:**
- **Power law + peak:** Fits data well
- **Gap models:** Not strongly preferred
- **Continuous distribution:** Also fits
- **Conclusion:** Gap less pronounced than expected

**Possible explanations:**
1. **Selection effects:** LIGO most sensitive to ~10-30 M☉
2. **Population mixing:** Multiple formation channels
3. **Real physics:** Gap genuinely less sharp
4. **Small number statistics:** Need more detections

#### 7.1.3 Implications

**For supernova models:**
- Fallback may be less bimodal than thought
- Continuous range of outcomes possible
- Need better explosion models

**For NS maximum mass:**
- M_max might be higher than 2.5 M☉
- Or some NSs can exceed temporarily
- Spin, temperature effects?

**For pressure contributions:**
- May be smaller than BHEM hypothesis predicts
- Or transition more gradual

### 7.2 Upper Gap Violations

#### 7.2.1 GW190521 Analysis

**Abbott et al. (2020) - Detailed study**

**Measurements:**
- Primary: 85⁺²¹₋₁₄ M☉
- Secondary: 66⁺¹⁷₋₁₈ M☉  
- Final: 142⁺²⁸₋₁₆ M☉
- All firmly in PISN gap

**Interpretations:**

**1. Hierarchical merger:**
- Both components from previous mergers
- Plausibility: Moderate (requires specific environment)

**2. Low metallicity:**
- Gap shifts to higher masses
- Z ~ 0.1 Z☉ would help
- Plausibility: Possible but uncertain

**3. Stellar rotation:**
- Chemically homogeneous evolution
- Extended cores
- Plausibility: Requires high rotation

**4. Alternative physics:**
- Modified gravity?
- Non-standard particle physics?
- Plausibility: Low (no other evidence)

**Bayes factors:**
- Hierarchical vs. stellar: ~2:1 (weak preference)
- Need more detections for discrimination

#### 7.2.2 Follow-up Observations

**Electromagnetic counterpart claim:**

**Graham et al. (2020):**
- Candidate optical flare from AGN J124942.3+344929
- 34 days after GW190521
- Position consistent with GW localization
- **Interpretation:** AGN disk environment?

**Controversy:**
- Chance alignment probability: ~5%
- No other EM counterpart expected for BBH
- Unless in gas-rich environment
- Needs confirmation

**Other searches:**
- X-ray: No counterpart
- Radio: No counterpart
- Neutrinos: No coincident events

### 7.3 Population Synthesis Challenges

#### 7.3.1 Inconsistencies

**Major puzzle:** Observed merger rates and masses inconsistent with standard stellar evolution

**Issues:**

1. **Too many massive BHs:**
   - X-ray binaries: mostly <20 M☉
   - LIGO: Peak at ~30 M☉
   - **Discrepancy:** Factor of 2-3 in typical mass

2. **Mass gap violations:**
   - Expected: Sharp boundaries
   - Observed: Populated throughout
   - **Discrepancy:** Gap less pronounced

3. **Merger rates:**
   - Early predictions: 1-100 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹
   - Observed: ~50-150 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹
   - Higher than most pessimistic models

4. **Spin distribution:**
   - Some models: Aligned, low spins
   - Observed: Misaligned, moderate spins
   - Suggests dynamical formation

#### 7.3.2 Model Revisions

**Updated models must include:**

**Dynamical formation:**
- Globular clusters: 20-50% of mergers
- Nuclear clusters: 10-30%
- AGN disks: 1-10%

**Stellar physics:**
- Mass loss: Lower than assumed
- Rotation: More important
- Binary evolution: Complex pathways

**Metallicity distribution:**
- Lower average Z?
- Wider distribution?
- Evolution with redshift

**Belczynski et al. (2020), Zevin et al. (2021):**
- Revised population synthesis
- Incorporate new physics
- Better match to LIGO
- Still significant uncertainties

## 8. Connections Between the Two Gaps

### 8.1 Unified Physics?

#### 8.1.1 Phase Transitions in Dense Matter

**Hypothesis:** Both gaps reflect phase transitions in matter

**Lower gap:**
- Nuclear → quark matter transition
- Density: 5-10 ρ₀
- Critical for NS → BH
- Creates instability

**Upper gap:**
- Photons → pairs transition
- Temperature: 2-3 × 10⁹ K
- Critical for massive cores
- Prevents BH formation

**Common theme:**
- Phase transitions create instabilities
- Instabilities create gaps in mass distribution
- Both at extremes of pressure/temperature

**BHEM interpretation:**
- Lower gap: Tier 1 → Tier 2 transition
- Upper gap: Could be higher tier transition (Tier 2 → Tier 3)?
- Same underlying mechanism at different scales

#### 8.1.2 Pressure as Key Parameter

**General relativistic insight:**

Both gaps involve extreme pressures:

**Lower gap:**
- Central pressure: P ~ 10³⁵ Pa
- P/ρc² ~ 0.3 (pressure comparable to density)
- Pressure contributes significantly to gravity

**Upper gap:**
- Radiation pressure: P_rad ~ aT⁴
- Pair production reduces P
- Instability when ∂P/∂ρ changes sign

**Analogy:**
- Both involve pressure becoming "too large"
- Lower gap: Pressure amplifies gravity too much
- Upper gap: Pair production reduces pressure too much
- Different physics, similar structural instability

### 8.2 Observational Connections

#### 8.2.1 Gravitational Wave Signatures

**Ringdown frequencies:**

Black holes formed from different masses ring at different frequencies:

**Lower gap BHs (5-10 M☉):**
- f_ringdown ~ 1-2 kHz
- LIGO sensitive
- Can probe formation mechanism

**Upper gap BHs (50-150 M☉):**
- f_ringdown ~ 100-300 Hz
- LIGO optimal sensitivity
- Can test for horizonless objects

**Quasinormal modes:**
- Depend on mass, spin, charge
- Test general relativity
- Search for deviations

**Berti et al. (2009), Cardoso & Pani (2019):**
- Ringdown spectroscopy
- Test BH nature
- Could reveal internal structure

#### 8.2.2 Tidal Deformability

**For objects in lower gap:**

If not pure BHs, might have:
- Tidal deformability Λ > 0
- Quadrupole moment Q ≠ -χ²M³
- Deviations from Kerr metric

**GW170817 (NS-NS merger):**
- Measured Λ̃ = 300⁺⁴²⁰₋₂₃₀
- Constrained NS EOS
- Set precedent for technique

**GW190814 (2.6 M☉ object):**
- No significant Λ measured
- Consistent with BH (Λ = 0)
- But uncertainties large
- Upper limit: Λ < 600

**Future detections:**
- Better sensitivity → tighter Λ constraints
- Could reveal exotic compact objects
- Test BHEM quark star hypothesis

#### 8.2.3 Electromagnetic Counterparts

**Different gap regions predict different EM signals:**

**Lower gap:**
- If NS → BH: Gamma-ray burst?
- If exotic object: Unusual transient?
- Merger ejecta composition

**Upper gap:**
- If PISN: No EM (complete disruption)
- If hierarchical: Standard BBH merger (no EM)
- If AGN environment: Possible optical/X-ray

**Distinguishing channels:**
- EM detection → NOT isolated binary
- No EM → Either isolated OR too distant
- Statistical correlation studies needed

### 8.3 Theoretical Connections

#### 8.3.1 Equation of State at Extreme Densities

**Grand unified EOS:**

Ideally want single framework spanning:
- Nuclear matter (ρ ~ ρ₀)
- Quark matter (ρ ~ 10 ρ₀)
- Ultrarelativistic matter (ρ → ∞)

**Challenges:**
- Different physics regimes
- Non-perturbative QCD at intermediate densities
- No experimental data above ρ₀

**Recent progress:**

**Annala et al. (2023), Brandes et al. (2023):**
- Bayesian inference + pQCD at high density
- Constrained EOS across all relevant densities
- Finds evidence for phase transitions
- Consistent with quark matter in massive NSs

**Implications:**
- Lower gap: Quark phase transition
- Upper gap: Separate (not dense matter)
- But both reflect matter under extreme conditions

#### 8.3.2 General Relativistic Effects

**Both gaps involve strong-field GR:**

**Lower gap:**
- M/R ~ 0.2-0.3 for NSs
- Gravity nonlinear
- Pressure amplification crucial

**Upper gap:**
- Pre-collapse: M/R ~ 0.001 (weak field)
- During PISN: Rapid dynamics
- Final BH: M/R = 0.5 (horizon)

**GR effects differ:**
- Lower gap: TOV equilibrium
- Upper gap: Dynamic evolution
- But both at extremes of gravity

## 9. Alternative Modeling Approaches

### 9.1 Beyond TOV: Rotating and Dynamic Models

#### 9.1.1 Rotating Neutron Stars

**Hartle-Thorne formalism** (Hartle 1967, Hartle & Thorne 1968)

**Approach:**
- Expand spacetime metric in powers of rotation rate Ω
- Slow rotation approximation: valid for Ω ≪ (GM/R³)^(1/2)
- Systematic inclusion of frame-dragging, oblateness

**Key results:**
- M_max increases by ~20% for maximum rotation
- Fastest pulsars: ~700 Hz (well below breakup)
- Deformation: ΔR/R ~ 0.01-0.05

**Implications for mass gap:**
- Rotating NSs can reach M ~ 2.8-3.0 M☉
- Might extend lower gap boundary
- Spin-down → eventual collapse possible

**Codes:**
- RNS (Stergioulas & Friedman 1995)
- LORENE (Bonazzola et al. 1998)
- cocal (Yoshida & Eriguchi 2001)

#### 9.1.2 Full General Relativistic Hydrodynamics

**For dynamic processes:**
- Core collapse
- NS mergers  
- Post-bounce evolution

**Codes:**
- Einstein Toolkit
- FLASH-GR
- SpEC
- Various groups' proprietary codes

**3+1 decomposition:**
- Split spacetime: 3D space + time
- Solve Einstein equations + hydrodynamics
- Evolve coupled system

**Challenges:**
- Computationally expensive
- Requires sophisticated numerics

## 10. Synthesis and Outstanding Questions

### 10.1 Current Understanding

#### 10.1.1 Lower Gap (2.5-5 M☉)

**Established facts:**
1. Gap was real in pre-LIGO electromagnetic observations
2. Maximum NS mass: M_max ~ 2.0-2.5 M☉ (from TOV + observations)
3. Minimum BH mass: M_min ~ 5 M☉ (from X-ray binaries)
4. LIGO is beginning to populate the gap

**Likely explanations:**
1. **TOV maximum mass:** Sets lower boundary firmly
2. **Supernova bimodality:** Successful (NS) vs. failed (BH)
3. **Fallback accretion:** Creates jump in remnant mass
4. **Quark matter transition:** Phase transition destabilizes

**Probability assessment:**
- TOV limit: >95% (observationally confirmed)
- Supernova mechanism: 70% (well-studied but uncertain)
- Quark transition: 50% (growing evidence)
- Pressure contribution: 30% (novel, needs testing)

**Outstanding questions:**
- Why are some objects in gap? (GW190814)
- Is transition truly sharp or gradual?

### 11.5 Final Perspective

The mass gap phenomena represent **windows into fundamental physics** at extreme conditions inaccessible in laboratories. Their study combines:
- **Observational astronomy** (electromagnetic + gravitational waves)
- **Theoretical astrophysics** (stellar evolution, explosions)
- **Nuclear physics** (equation of state, QCD)
- **General relativity** (strong-field gravity)
- **Computational modeling** (simulations across many scales)

The next decade promises **transformative discoveries**:
- Hundreds of LIGO detections mapping mass distributions precisely
- Next-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer)
- Multi-messenger observations identifying formation channels
- Improved theoretical modeling matching observations

The **BHEM hypothesis** offers a novel perspective connecting mass gaps to pressure contributions and internal BH structure. While speculative, it is **testable** through quantitative TOV calculations and observational constraints.

**Bottom line:** Mass gaps are not mere curiosities but fundamental clues about the nature of matter, gravity, and compact objects. Their full explanation will require integration of multiple physics domains and likely spring surprises.
