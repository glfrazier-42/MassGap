\section{TOV Equation Analysis}\label{s:tov}
%==============================================================================

The Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations
\citep{Tolman1939,OppenheimerVolkoff1939} govern the hydrostatic
structure of a self-gravitating, spherically symmetric body in general
relativity.  In particular, the pressure gradient equation,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tov}
  \frac{dP}{dr}
  = -\frac{\bigl(\rho + P/c^{2}\bigr)
           \bigl(m + 4\pi r^{3}\,P/c^{2}\bigr)\,G}
          {r\bigl(r - 2Gm/c^{2}\bigr)}\,,
\end{equation}
%
contains terms in which the pressure~$P$ itself contributes to the
source of gravity.  As a consequence, the gravitational mass of a
compact star---the mass that determines its orbit and gravitational
field---exceeds its baryonic (rest) mass:
$M_{g} > M_{b}$.
We define $M_{g}$ as the total gravitational mass enclosed at the
stellar surface.  The baryonic mass~$M_{b}$ is defined so as to
isolate the ground-state structural energy of each matter type,
excluding the internal kinetic energy that generates pressure.
For neutron-star matter, $M_{b}$ is the integral of the baryon
rest-mass density~$\rho_{0}$ over coordinate volume---the mass the
baryons would have if dispersed to infinity with zero internal energy.
For quark-star matter, $M_{b}$ is the integral of the bag vacuum
energy density~$4B/c^{2}$ over coordinate volume---the QCD vacuum cost
of creating the quark-matter volume, with no quark kinetic
contribution.  Both definitions strip the internal energy that
generates pressure and keep only the structural ground state.  The
difference $M_{g} - M_{b}$ then measures pressure's contribution to
the gravitating mass for both matter types, and grows with
compactness.

The relationship between pressure, density, and composition is encoded
in the equation of state (EOS).  For neutron-star matter, we adopt
six finite-temperature nuclear EOS tables from the
\texttt{stellarcollapse.org} repository \citep{OConnorOtt2010},
evaluated on the cold, beta-equilibrated slice: LS180, LS220, and
LS375 \citep{LattimerSwesty1991}, SFHo \citep{SteinerFischerHempel2013},
DD2 \citep{TypelRopkeKlaehn2010}, and HShen \citep{Shen1998}.  These
span the range from soft (LS180, $K = 180$~MeV) to stiff (LS375,
$K = 375$~MeV) nuclear incompressibilities, producing maximum
neutron-star masses of roughly $2.0$--$3.0\;M_{\odot}$.  For
quark-star matter we use the MIT bag model \citep{Chodos1974} with
three representative bag constants, $B = 60$, $100$, and
$160\;\text{MeV}/\text{fm}^{3}$, spanning the range from soft to stiff
quark matter.  These produce maximum gravitational masses of roughly
$2.0$, $1.6$, and $1.2\;M_{\odot}$, respectively.  While pure quark
stars remain theoretical, recent Bayesian analyses of neutron-star
observations find strong evidence for quark-matter cores above
$\sim\!2\;M_{\odot}$ \citep{Annala2020}.

  }
  \label{fig:tov_mr}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:tov_mr} shows the standard mass--radius diagram
obtained by integrating Eq.~\eqref{eq:tov} across a range of central
pressures for each EOS.  The neutron-star branches span radii of
$\sim\!11$--$15$~km, while the quark-star branches are more compact,
reaching $\sim\!7$--$11$~km at maximum mass depending on~$B$.  Both
families terminate at a maximum gravitational mass beyond which no
stable equilibrium exists.

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/tov_mg_vs_mb.png}
  \caption{Gravitational Mass $M_g$ vs. Baryonic Mass $M_b$}
  \note{Same set of
    EOS as Fig.~\ref{fig:tov_mr}.  The dotted line is the Newtonian
    limit $M_{g} = M_{b}$.  Neutron-star curves (solid) lie just above
    this line, with pressure contributing $\sim\!10$--15\% of~$M_{g}$.
    Quark-star curves (dashed) show dramatically larger separation;
    their baryonic mass is defined via the bag vacuum energy~$4B/c^{2}$
    alone, so that the ultrarelativistic quark kinetic energy
    (which generates pressure) appears entirely in $M_{g} - M_{b}$.
    Filled circles mark the maximum-mass configuration.}
  \label{fig:tov_mg_mb}
\end{figure}

The key result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tov_mg_mb}, which plots
$M_{g}$ against~$M_{b}$.  Every TOV solution sits above the
$M_{g} = M_{b}$ line; the departure grows with compactness.  The
neutron-star curves (solid) hug the diagonal, with the pressure
contribution amounting to $\sim\!10$--15\% of~$M_{g}$ at maximum mass.
The quark-star curves (dashed) depart dramatically: because the
baryonic mass counts only the bag vacuum energy ($4B/c^{2}$), the
entire ultrarelativistic quark kinetic energy ($3P/c^{2}$) appears as
excess gravitational mass.  At the quark-star maximum,
$M_{g}/M_{b} \sim 1.5$--2, meaning that pressure-generated energy
accounts for roughly half the gravitating mass.

The implications for the mass gap are direct.  When a neutron star
exceeds its TOV limit and collapses, it transitions from
neutron-degenerate to quark-degenerate matter.  Because quark matter
is more compressible, the resulting quark star is more compact and its
pressure contribution to~$M_{g}$ increases.  The baryonic mass is
conserved in the collapse, but the gravitational mass jumps upward.
The lower mass gap---the observed deficit of compact objects between
$\sim\!2.5$ and $\sim\!5\;M_{\odot}$
\citep{ThompsonKochanekAdams2019}---is the signature of this
transition. It spans the range between the highest neutron-star
$M_{g}$ and the lowest extant quark-star $M_{g}$,
and the lowest stable quark-star is a black hole.

The spread of neutron-star EOS and quark-star bag constants in
Figures~\ref{fig:tov_ns} and~\ref{fig:tov_qs} reflects the current
quantitative uncertainty in dense-matter physics: we do not yet know
precisely how these stellar objects behave.  Nonetheless, the curves are
indicative.  Both families show a steepening relationship between $M_{b}$
and $M_{g}$ with increasing baryonic mass, and quark stars consistently
show a far larger pressure contribution to $M_{g}$ than neutron stars at
comparable $M_{b}$.  However, while the TOV analysis demonstrates that a
phase transition would produce a mass gap, it does not by itself provide
evidence that neutron stars are in fact collapsing; that evidence is
presented in the following section.

\section{Observational Evidence for Collapse}\label{s:collapse}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Pulsars with Known Mass}\label{ss:pulsar-masses}

We assemble a sample of 37 pulsars with dynamically measured masses
from the \texttt{stellarcollapse.org} compilation
\citep{OConnorOtt2010}, cross-matched with spin periods from the ATNF
Pulsar Catalogue \citep{Manchester2005}.  The sample spans
$1.18$--$2.74\;M_{\odot}$ and includes four binary categories: NS--WD
(21 systems), NS--NS (7), X-Ray/Optical (2), and NS--MS (3).  Three
of the most precisely measured high-mass pulsars---J0740+6620
($2.08 \pm 0.07\;M_{\odot}$; \citealt{Cromartie2020}), J0348+0432
($2.01 \pm 0.04\;M_{\odot}$), and J1614$-$2230
($1.928 \pm 0.017\;M_{\odot}$)---anchor the high end of the
distribution.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/pulsar_mass_period.png}
  \caption{Mass vs.\ spin period for 37 pulsars with dynamical mass
    measurements.  \textbf{(a)}~Scatter plot color-coded by binary
    category.  \textbf{(b)}~Period range per mass bin: horizontal
    segments span from the fastest to the slowest period in each bin,
    with sample size annotated.  The fastest periods are comparable
    across all bins ($\sim\!2$--5~ms), but the slowest period drops
    from $\sim\!2800$~ms to $\sim\!17$~ms as mass increases.}
  \label{fig:pulsar_mass_period}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:pulsar_mass_period} reveals the key pattern.  When the
sample is binned by mass, the fastest spin period in each bin is
roughly constant at $\sim\!2$--5~ms---millisecond pulsars exist at all
masses.  But the slowest period shrinks dramatically: from
$\sim\!2800$~ms in the $1.0$--$1.5\;M_{\odot}$ bin down to
$\sim\!17$~ms above $2.5\;M_{\odot}$.  Massive pulsars are found
exclusively at fast spin rates; no slowly rotating high-mass neutron
star has been observed.

This pattern is consistent with spin providing centrifugal support
that delays collapse past the TOV stability limit.  As pulsars spin
down via magnetic dipole radiation, those with the highest baryonic
mass cross the stability boundary first, disappearing from the
observable population.  Only those massive pulsars that still retain
fast spin remain visible.  The next subsection examines the broader
pulsar population to test this interpretation at a statistical level.
