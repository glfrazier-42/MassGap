\section{TOV Equation Analysis}\label{s:tov}
%==============================================================================

The Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations
\citep{Tolman1939,OppenheimerVolkoff1939} govern the hydrostatic
structure of a self-gravitating, spherically symmetric body in general
relativity.  In particular, the pressure gradient equation,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tov}
  \frac{dP}{dr}
  = -\frac{\bigl(\rho + P/c^{2}\bigr)
           \bigl(m + 4\pi r^{3}\,P/c^{2}\bigr)\,G}
          {r\bigl(r - 2Gm/c^{2}\bigr)}\,,
\end{equation}
%
contains terms in which the pressure~$P$ itself contributes to the
source of gravity.  As a consequence, the gravitational mass of a
compact star---the mass that determines its orbit and gravitational
field---exceeds its baryonic (rest) mass:
$M_{g} > M_{b}$.
We define $M_{g}$ as the total gravitational mass enclosed at the
stellar surface.  The baryonic mass~$M_{b}$ is defined so as to
isolate the ground-state structural energy of each matter type,
excluding the internal kinetic energy that generates pressure.
For neutron-star matter, $M_{b}$ is the integral of the baryon
rest-mass density~$\rho_{0}$ over coordinate volume---the mass the
baryons would have if dispersed to infinity with zero internal energy.
For quark-star matter, $M_{b}$ is the integral of the bag vacuum
energy density~$4B/c^{2}$ over coordinate volume---the QCD vacuum cost
of creating the quark-matter volume, with no quark kinetic
contribution.  Both definitions strip the internal energy that
generates pressure and keep only the structural ground state.  The
difference $M_{g} - M_{b}$ then measures pressure's contribution to
the gravitating mass for both matter types, and grows with
compactness.

The relationship between pressure, density, and composition is encoded
in the equation of state (EOS).  For neutron-star matter, we adopt
six finite-temperature nuclear EOS tables from the
\texttt{stellarcollapse.org} repository \citep{OConnorOtt2010},
evaluated on the cold, beta-equilibrated slice: LS180, LS220, and
LS375 \citep{LattimerSwesty1991}, SFHo \citep{SteinerFischerHempel2013},
DD2 \citep{TypelRopkeKlaehn2010}, and HShen \citep{Shen1998}.  These
span the range from soft (LS180, $K = 180$~MeV) to stiff (LS375,
$K = 375$~MeV) nuclear incompressibilities, producing maximum
neutron-star masses of roughly $2.0$--$3.0\;M_{\odot}$.  For
quark-star matter we use the MIT bag model \citep{Chodos1974} with
three representative bag constants, $B = 60$, $100$, and
$160\;\text{MeV}/\text{fm}^{3}$, spanning the range from soft to stiff
quark matter.  These produce maximum gravitational masses of roughly
$2.0$, $1.6$, and $1.2\;M_{\odot}$, respectively.  While pure quark
stars remain theoretical, recent Bayesian analyses of neutron-star
observations find strong evidence for quark-matter cores above
$\sim\!2\;M_{\odot}$ \citep{Annala2020}.

Figure~\ref{fig:tov_mr} shows the standard mass--radius diagram
obtained by integrating Eq.~\eqref{eq:tov} across a range of central
pressures for each EOS.  The neutron-star branches span radii of
$\sim\!11$--$15$~km, while the quark-star branches are more compact,
reaching $\sim\!7$--$11$~km at maximum mass depending on~$B$.  Both
families terminate at a maximum gravitational mass beyond which no
stable equilibrium exists.

%%   \label{fig:tov_mg_mb}
%% \end{figure}

The key result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tov_mg_mb}, which plots
$M_{g}$ against~$M_{b}$.  Every TOV solution sits above the
$M_{g} = M_{b}$ line; the departure grows with compactness.  The
neutron-star curves (solid) hug the diagonal, with the pressure
contribution amounting to $\sim\!10$--15\% of~$M_{g}$ at maximum mass.
The quark-star curves (dashed) depart dramatically: because the
baryonic mass counts only the bag vacuum energy ($4B/c^{2}$), the
entire ultrarelativistic quark kinetic energy ($3P/c^{2}$) appears as
excess gravitational mass.  At the quark-star maximum,
$M_{g}/M_{b} \sim 1.5$--2, meaning that pressure-generated energy
accounts for roughly half the gravitating mass.

The implications for the mass gap are direct.  When a neutron star
exceeds its TOV limit, it collapses from neutron-degenerate to
quark-degenerate matter.  The baryonic mass is conserved, but because
the resulting quark star is more compact, its pressure contribution
to~$M_{g}$ is larger: the gravitational mass jumps upward.  The lower
mass gap---the observed deficit of compact objects between $\sim\!2.5$
and $\sim\!5\;M_{\odot}$ \citep{ThompsonKochanekAdams2019}---is the
signature of this transition, spanning from the pre-collapse
neutron-star~$M_{g}$ to the post-collapse quark-star~$M_{g}$.
Crucially, the post-collapse gravitational mass exceeds the maximum
stable quark-star solution: the object is not a quark star but a black
hole. Yet, the smallest observed black holes are over
5\;$\text{M}_\odot$, suggesting that black holes have a pressure
component to their $M_g$, which in turn implies that they are coherent
stellar objects---they are quark stars.

The spread of EOS and bag constants in Fig.~\ref{fig:tov_figs}
reflects current uncertainty in dense-matter physics; the precise
behavior of matter at these densities is not yet known.
Nonetheless, the qualitative picture is robust.  Both families show
a steepening $M_{g}$--$M_{b}$ relationship with increasing baryonic
mass, and quark stars consistently exhibit a far larger pressure
contribution to~$M_{g}$ than neutron stars at comparable~$M_{b}$.
That said, the TOV analysis demonstrates only that a phase
transition \emph{would} produce a mass gap whose endpoint is a
black hole; it does not, by itself, show that neutron stars
\emph{do} collapse.  Indeed, the absence of a stable post-collapse
solution might be read as evidence against collapse.
Observational evidence that collapse is occurring is presented in
the following section.

%==============================================================================
\section{Observational Evidence for Collapse}\label{s:collapse}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Pulsars with Known Mass}\label{ss:pulsar-masses}

We assemble a sample of \pulsarCount{} pulsars with dynamically measured masses
from the \texttt{stellarcollapse.org} compilation
\citep{OConnorOtt2010}, cross-matched with spin periods from the ATNF
Pulsar Catalogue \citep{Manchester2005}.  The sample spans
$1.18$--$2.74\;M_{\odot}$ and includes four binary categories: NS--WD
(21 systems), NS--NS (7), X-Ray/Optical (2), and NS--MS (3).  Three
of the most precisely measured high-mass pulsars---J0740+6620
($2.08 \pm 0.07\;M_{\odot}$; \citealt{Cromartie2020}), J0348+0432
($2.01 \pm 0.04\;M_{\odot}$), and J1614$-$2230
($1.928 \pm 0.017\;M_{\odot}$)---anchor the high end of the
distribution.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/pulsar_mass_period.png}
  \caption{Mass vs.\ Spin Period, Pulsars with Known Mass}
  \note{Examined \pulsarCount{} pulsars with dynamical mass
    measurements.  (a)~Scatter plot of 37 pulsars with known mass. No
    pulsar above 1.6 $\text{M}_\odot$ has a slower period than
    80~ns. (b)~Period range per mass-bin: horizontal segments span
    from the fastest to the slowest period in each bin, with sample
    size annotated.  The fastest periods are comparable across all
    bins (\pulsarFastestAll--\pulsarFastestSecond~ms), but the slowest
    period drops from \pulsarSlowestAll~ms to \pulsarSlowestTop~ms as
    mass increases. Note also that the number of pulsars in each bin
    decreases as the masses increase.}
  \label{fig:pulsar_mass_period}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:pulsar_mass_period} reveals the key pattern.  When the
sample is binned by mass, the fastest spin period in each bin is
comparable (\pulsarFastestAll--\pulsarFastestSecond~ms), showing that
millisecond pulsars exist at all masses.  But the slowest period
shrinks dramatically: from \pulsarSlowestLow~ms in the
$1.0$--$1.5\;M_{\odot}$ bin down to \pulsarSlowestTop~ms above
$2.5\;M_{\odot}$.  Massive pulsars are found exclusively at fast spin
rates; no slowly rotating high-mass neutron star has been observed.

This pattern is consistent with spin providing centrifugal support
that delays collapse past the TOV stability limit.  As pulsars spin
down, those with the highest baryonic
mass cross the stability boundary first, disappearing from the
observable population.  Only those massive pulsars that still retain
fast spin remain visible.  A Spearman rank correlation confirms the
trend: $\rho = \pulsarSpearmanRho$ ($p = \pulsarSpearmanP$),
indicating a statistically significant negative association between
mass and spin period.

That said, these \pulsarCount{} pulsars are the subset with
dynamically measured masses---a small, heterogeneous sample.  The
next subsection uses the full ATNF pulsar catalogue to test this
interpretation with stronger statistics.

\subsection{Pulsar Population Analysis}\label{ss:pulsar-population}

The preceding analysis showed that among pulsars with measured masses,
the most massive are found exclusively at fast spin rates.  If larger
pulsars collapse as they spin down, the effect should leave a clear
imprint on the period distribution of the full pulsar population.

We draw \popTotal{} pulsars from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue
\citep{Manchester2005} and restrict the sample to the \popNormal{}
normal (non-recycled) pulsars with $P \geq 100$~ms.  Under magnetic
dipole braking ($P\dot{P} \approx \text{const}$), the period
derivative $\dot{P} \propto 1/P$, so pulsars traverse a given period
interval more slowly at long periods.  The dwell time in an interval
$dP$ scales as $P\,dP$, and in a steady-state population with
constant birth rate the number density per log-decade of period should
be non-decreasing.

\begin{figure}[t]
\subcaptionbox{Density per log-decade\label{fig:pop_logbins}}{%

\subcaptionbox{Fixed-width bins vs.\ model\label{fig:pop_linear}}{%

\caption{Period Distribution of Normal Pulsars ($P \geq 100$~ms)}
\note{(a)~Pulsars per log-decade in four logarithmically spaced bins.
  Blue bars are consistent with a non-decreasing density; red bars
  fall below the peak, with Poisson significance annotated.
  (b)~Observed counts in \popLinearBinWidth{}~ms bins (blue) compared
  with the steady-state dipole spin-down prediction (count $\propto P$,
  red step line, normalised at 200--300~ms).  Note the logarithmic
  vertical axis for (b).}
\label{fig:pop_figs}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:pop_logbins} tests this prediction.  The density
rises from \popDensityA{} pulsars per decade in the \popBinRangeA{}
bin to a peak of \popDensityB{} in the \popBinRangeB{} bin, then
drops precipitously: \popDensityC{} in the \popBinRangeC{} bin (a
\popSigmaBC{}$\sigma$ deficit relative to the non-decreasing null)
and just \popDensityD{} in the \popBinRangeD{} bin
(\popSigmaCD{}$\sigma$).  Figure~\ref{fig:pop_linear} shows the same
data in fixed-width bins alongside the steady-state prediction.  The
observed counts fall exponentially while the model rises linearly; by
3~s the gap exceeds an order of magnitude.

The conventional explanation for the missing long-period pulsars is
luminosity death: the cessation of coherent radio emission below a
critical spin-down power \citep{FaucherGiguereKaspi2006}.  However,
the death line operates at $P \gtrsim 5$~s for typical magnetic fields
and so does not account for a population decline that is already
observable at 0.1~s and is distributed across the entire range of
pulsar spin periods.  Population synthesis studies have invoked
magnetic field decay to fill the gap, but the required timescales are
uncertain and \citet{FaucherGiguereKaspi2006} found no evidence for
significant field decay over pulsar lifetimes.  Most recently,
\citet{Sautron2024} showed that a death line is not necessary to
reproduce the observed $P$--$\dot{P}$ diagram: their simulations with
and without a death line are statistically indistinguishable once the
maximum pulsar age is capped at $\sim\!4 \times 10^{7}$~yr.  What is
required is simply that old pulsars are absent---but the physical
reason for their absence remains unexplained in that framework.

The collapse hypothesis of \S\ref{ss:pulsar-masses} offers a natural
explanation for observed population dynamics.  As pulsars spin down,
those with baryonic masses near the TOV limit lose centrifugal support
and collapse to quark stars (black holes), physically removing them
from the observable population.  This predicts a gradual thinning of
the population that begins well before the nominal death
line---precisely the pattern seen in Figures~\ref{fig:pop_logbins}
and~\ref{fig:pop_linear}.  It further predicts that the deficit should
be strongest among the most massive pulsars, a test that targeted mass
measurements at long periods could address.
