# Mass Gap

A paper and supporting analysis arguing that the 2.5--5.0 M_sun mass
gap between neutron stars and black holes is the natural signature of
baryonic matter undergoing a phase transition from neutron degeneracy
to quark degeneracy -- and that black holes are quark stars with real
internal structure, not singularities.

## Abstract

Abstract to be written.

## Reproducing the Analysis

The goal is full reproducibility: clone, download data, run scripts,
and build the PDF. All figures and tables are generated from raw data;
nothing is hard-coded in the paper.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- LaTeX distribution with `pdflatex` and `bibtex`
- Required Python packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows/Cygwin: venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data

The `data/` directory is in `.gitignore`. You must download the
following datasets manually and place them in `data/`.

**GWTC catalog** (`gwtc_catalog.csv`):
Download from the [Gravitational Wave Open Science Center](https://gwosc.org).
This provides BBH merger parameters (masses, spins, mass deficits)
used by the merger spin analysis.

**ATNF Pulsar Catalogue** (`data/raw/psrcat.db`):
Download the full catalogue database from the
[ATNF Pulsar Catalogue](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/)
and place `psrcat.db` in `data/raw/`. Then run the extraction scripts
to produce the CSVs used by the analysis:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/extract_atnf_periods.py
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/extract_atnf_name_mapping.py
```

This produces `data/atnf_pulsar_periods.csv` and
`data/atnf_name_mapping.csv`.

**Neutron star masses** (`stellar_collapse_ns_masses.csv`):
Included in the repository. Hand-curated from data published by
[stellarcollapse.org](https://stellarcollapse.org). Provides measured
neutron star masses used in the TOV and pulsar population analyses.

**EOS tables** (`data/eos/*.txt`):
Download the HDF5 tables from
[stellarcollapse.org](https://stellarcollapse.org/equationofstate)
and extract cold beta-equilibrium slices:

```bash
# Download HDF5 tables (~2-4 GB each) from stellarcollapse.org
bash scripts/download_eos_tables.sh

# Extract cold beta-equilibrium slices
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/extract_all_eos.py
```

This produces text tables (LS180, LS220, LS375, SFHo, DD2, HShen)
used by the TOV solver.

**Combined pulsar mass-period data** (`pulsar_mass_period_combined.csv`):
Generated by `scripts/merge_mass_period_final.py` from the ATNF and
stellar collapse datasets above.

### Running the Analysis

All scripts are run from the project root:

```bash
# Merge pulsar mass and period data
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/merge_mass_period_final.py

# Pulsar mass-spin correlation analysis
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/analyze_mass_spin_correlation.py

# Population survival analysis
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/population_survival_v2.py

# BH merger spin analysis (GWTC catalog)
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/run_bh_merger_spin.py
```

On Windows/Cygwin, replace `python` with `venv/Scripts/python.exe`.

### Building the Paper

```bash
cd latex-paper && make
```

This runs `pdflatex` and `bibtex` to produce `mass_gap.pdf`.
