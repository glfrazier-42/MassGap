Dear Editors,

I submit for consideration in The Astrophysical Journal Letters the
manuscript "Quark Degeneracy and the Lower Mass Gap."

The lower mass gap---the observed deficit of compact objects between
roughly 2.5 and 5 solar masses---has lacked a physical explanation
despite two decades of debate. This paper proposes that the gap is
the signature of the phase transition from neutron-degenerate to
quark-degenerate matter. I present four independent lines of evidence:

1. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations predict a gravitational-mass
   jump at the neutron-to-quark transition that spans the observed gap;

2. Pulsars of 2 to 2.5 M-sun are found exclusively at fast spin rates,
   consistent with centrifugal support delaying collapse (i.e., obects
   below 5 solar masses become black holes);

3. Failed supernovae confirm that stellar cores well below 5 solar masses
   collapse to black holes; and

4. Analysis of LIGO binary black hole mergers in the GWTC catalog reveals
   spin-dependent mass deficits that exceed spinning-GR predictions by
   precisely the amount a structured-matter model predicts.

A direct implication of this analysis is that black holes are not
singularities but structured quark-degenerate objects---a conclusion
required by, and consistent with, general relativity.

We believe this work is appropriate for ApJL because it offers a
unified physical explanation for a long-standing observational puzzle,
draws on multiple independent datasets (gravitational-wave, pulsar, and
stellar), and carries implications for the nature of black holes that
are of broad interest across astrophysics.

This manuscript is original, has not been previously published, and is
not currently under review elsewhere. We are submitting under the Dual
Anonymous Review option.
